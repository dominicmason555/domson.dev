    Personal website of

    (<span class="p-name">Dominic Mason</span>).

    I made this site to blog about hobby projects, and whatever else I feel
    like.
    The site is built by a homemade static site generator, written as one of my
    first projects in
    <a href="https://clojure.org/Clojure" class="plain">Clojure</a>, it's called
    <a href="https://github.com/dominicmason555/nogo" class="plain">Nogo</a>.
  </p>

    So far I've probably put more effort into getting
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)" class="plain">ATOM</a>/
    <a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/" class="plain">JSON</a>/
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats" class="plain">h-feed</a>/
    <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt" class="plain">TWTXT</a>
    feeds working than I've put into the blog posts themselves, but that may
    change with time.

      My <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/" class="plain">Gemini</a>
      capsule where I usually write posts first:
