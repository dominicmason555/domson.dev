  <h2>Project: Light Weather</h2>

  <p> I made a temperature/pressure/humidity/gas sensor and general I/O
    interface for my "smart flat". This is a blog post / write-up of how
    and why I did that.</p>

        width="929" height="720">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>The finished board of Light Weather V3</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Why would you do that?</h3>

  <p> It wasn't particularly necessary, but I quite like seeing all the data
    it records in various graphs. The aforementioned "smart flat" is a flat
    full of many zigbee and
    <abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> devices,
    including all the lights and a
    lot of smart plugs. Most of this is controlled by timers in Node-RED
    running on a Raspberry Pi, and from Zigbee buttons. When I'm out of
    reach of those buttons, I have a Telegram bot, or an Android app I
    wrote, but since I wrote it, the websocket in its backend keeps
    dropping out and I haven't been bothered to fix it yet.
  </p>

  <p> The general idea with this project, as with most of the "smart flat",
    isn't that it's the best or easiest way to get anything done, or that
    off-the-shelf devices couldn't get the job done. Part of it is that I
    don't trust whatever cheap closed-source devices I'd get with access to
    my WiFi, despite how fun it may be to join a botnet. Another part is
    that completely over-engineering things that could be simple is good
    for learning new skills, and generally keeps your brain from going
    smooth. Since it's a hobby project with about one and a half users on
    average, there aren't really any consequences to over-cooking
    everything and making it take ages. </p>

  <p> The main reason though, is that it's fun and satisfying to make
    something where the entire design is exactly for myself and my strange
    use case. It means that I know how the whole system works, and the only
    barrier to fixing/changing/adding any part of it is whether I can be
    bothered or find the time. None of the functionality is hidden from me
    in proprietary unchangable firmware blobs. The functionality isn't
    locked down to a use case chosen by some marketing department aiming to
    be just sufficient to as many thousands of people as possible. </p>

  <p> That's the general idea. I'm not making a product to sell to the
    masses, I'm making something just for myself, and anyone else that
    visits my flat and has to be subjected to it. </p>

  <h3>The beginning</h3>

  <p> After a group project at university however many years ago, I was left
    with a collection of temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors. The
    project was about making a mesh network of battery-powered
    environmental sensors. Having only got as far as breadboarding the
    project, it felt wrong to leave the parts to become e-waste, so I
    decided to use the sensors on my house instead. </p>

  <p> I started with just wiring the sensors with jumper wire to ESP8266 dev
    boards, and leaving them around the house connected to USB phone
    chargers. Using the Arduino core for them, I made them deep sleep for a
    minute, then wake up, take a measurement, then encode it as
    <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> and
    send it over <abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr>
    to my Pi. The Pi then had a Python script that
    listened for these measurements, and added them to a
    Postrgres/TimescaleDB database running in a container. The Python
    script is on my <a class="plain" href="https://github.com/dominicmason555/mqtt_to_timescale">GitHub</a>,
    and it has an eye kept on it using the Supervisor Python project
    to make sure it gets resurrected if it dies. I've not checked the logs
    to see if it does die and get saved by Supervisor or if it just doesn't
    die, but either way it's been running for around three years now
    without noticeable outages.
  </p>

  <p> The Pi software worked better than I'd expected, and the hardware
    worked fine, but early this year, I decided it just looked too ugly.
  </p>

  <h3>Light Weather - Version 1</h3>

  <figure>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="/images/lightweather_v1_photo.avif">
      <img src="/images/lightweather_v1_photo.jpg" class="fullwidth" alt="Version 1, hand-soldered on perfboard"
        width="720" height="577">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Version 1, hand-soldered on perfboard</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p> While I may have paid more attention to the programming modules, my
    degree was in <em>electronic</em> and computer engineering, and having
    a rats nest of rainbow jumper wires in view of the whole flat was at
    least a little embarrassing. I decided to solder the project together
    on some perfboard. </p>

  <p> While laying out the ESP8266 DevKit-C, Adafruit BMP388
    temperature/pressure sensor module, and Adafruit AHT20
    temperature/humidity sensor module on the perfboard, I noticed that the
    place I had the current system plugged in on the shelves was next to
    some fairy lights and a USB lamp, and that those should be fairly easy
    to control. I had a USB power switch board (made by 8086 Consultancy)
    left over from an old Pi project, and it seemed perfect for controlling
    the USB lamp. It was a breakout for a SIP32508 load switch
    <abbr title="Integrated Circuit">IC</abbr>, which
    acts as a high-side switch suitable for 5 V that can be controlled from
    a 3.3 V input pin. For the fairy lights, they originally ran on 3 AAA
    batteries for 4.5 V, and from having a go with a variable PSU, they
    seemed to draw 110 mA at 5 V, and more importantly didn't pop. I added a
    through-hole
    <abbr title="Negative-Positive-Negative Bipolar Junction Transistor">NPN BJT</abbr>
    (2N2222) to the circuit as a low-side switch for the fairy lights.
  </p>

  <p> It was then easy to make the ESP8266 code listen for
    <abbr title="Message Queuing Telemetry Transport">MQTT</abbr> messages that
    could make it toggle
    <abbr title="Input/Output">IO</abbr> pins. The code had to have the deep-sleep
    removed so it wouldn't miss messages, but the deep-sleep feature was
    mainly left behind from its original purpose of being battery powered
    anyway.
  </p>

  <p> MQTT control
    was good for timers, and for when I was in arms reach of
    one of my Zigbee buttons, but for more convenience I added an
    <abbr title="Infrared">IR</abbr>
    receiver so that a generic IR remote could
    control its lights. I then
    made it output the remote control button presses over
    MQTT, so that I
    could connect them to the smart lights etc. through Node-RED.
  </p>

  <p> The project now had lots more functionality, and did look less ugly
    than what came before, but to call it <em>not</em> ugly would be a
    stretch. It looked like enough of a project to be worthy of a name
    though, and since it controlled lights and measured weather, and I was
    listening to Weather Report while programming it, it was given the name
    Light Weather. </p>

  <h3>Light Weather - Version 2</h3>

  <figure>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="/images/lightweather_v2_photo.webp">

    <figcaption>
      Version 2, V1 on a <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p> <em>Less</em> ugly was a definite improvement, but I felt I could do
    better. A lot of the force behind this project was how prominently it
    was placed in the room, which made its messy construction a lot more
    noticeable. </p>

  <p> I watch a few electronics channels on YouTube, and when they make a
    project, the last step always seems to be making a custom
    <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr> for it. I
    would too if I was offered as much sponsorship money as them. Despite
    it being product placement, the custom PCBs did look a lot nicer than
    anything I'd made, so I decided to have a go. Chinese PCB manufacturers
    are surprisingly cheap, even accounting for shipping. After this, I
    installed SponsorBlock to protect me from buying anything based on
    product placement again, we'll see how well it works.
  </p>

  <p> At uni, I had to choose between making a C++/Qt GUI program for viewing
    3D models, and making a switch-mode power supply PCB, and I chose the
    former, so I had no experience of PCB design there. On a work placement
    I had designed a PCB, but it was a capacitor bank that took three-phase
    power straight out of the rectifier, so that comically thick PCB didn't
    have much in common with this project. As I had little experience, I
    decided to make the PCB as simple as possible, by only making minor
    changes to my previous design. I kept the ESP8266 and sensors on their
    development boards, but put the SIP32508 load switch
    <abbr title="Integrated Circuit">IC</abbr> directly on the
    PCB, along with a logic-level
    <abbr title="Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor">MOSFET</abbr>
    instead of the 2N2222. I had
    wanted to use a MOSFET in version 1, but I couldn't find one that was
    through-hole and operable with 3.3 V logic to make the implementation
    simple. The <a class="plain" href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_Alpha-Omega-Semicon-_C43307.html">
      AO3416</a> was suitable, but only in the surface-mount SOT23
    package.
  </p>

  <p> The PCB design was extremely simple, since it was mostly just replacing
    the perfboard and tangled wiring, nothing on it needed to switch at
    high frequencies or carry large currents. Learning enough KiCAD to make
    this was surprisingly easy, I didn't even have to resort to YouTube
    tutorials. I was pretty good at resisting the temptation of
    feature-creep, knowing that it was my first real PCB for a hobby
    project, it was all quite new and unproven. I said it was easy, but the
    first time I sent the PCB off to be made, they emailed me back saying
    I'd forgotten to add the actual shape of the PCB for them to cut it
    down to in the <code>Edge.Cuts</code> layer, which was mildly
    embarrassing. </p>

  <p> I purchased AliExpress' finest reflow hot plate and solder paste, lined
    up the components, and cooked it on my kitchen table with all the
    windows open. To my surprise, the whole thing worked first time, with
    the only slight mistake being that the <abbr title="Infrared">IR</abbr>
    receiver had the wrong footprint, so I had to bend the middle leg around to
    become the left leg.
  </p>

  <p> Perfect, job done, can put the project to bed. Although I'd made it
    look a bit more professional than before, the fact that I was still
    using off-the-shelf dev boards for the
    <abbr title="Microcontroller Unit">MCU</abbr> and sensors was quite
    noticeable, to me anyway.
  </p>

  <h3>Light Weather - Version 3</h3>

      <img src="/images/lightweather_pcbviewer.jpg" class="fullwidth" alt="The PCB layout of Light Weather V3"

    </picture>
    <figcaption>
      The <abbr title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</abbr>
      layout of Light Weather V3
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p> With my new-found skill of ordering PCBs off the internet, I decided to
    try making something that I actually enjoyed looking at. For me, that
    meant no dev boards sticking up showing that their contents were too
    difficult, and having the components spaced somewhat close to each
    other, since soldering densely packed components wasn't anywhere near
    as hard as I'd expected when I was laying out the last version.
  </p>

  <p> So I started a new project in KiCAD, and ordered some ESP32-C3 WROOM
    modules from LCSC. These are modules that include the MCU, crystal,
    flash, and a PCB antenna. They're very compact, and are soldered
    straight to the main PCB. I resisted the temptation to go straight to
    the raw chips and get my head around tuning a 2.4 GHz PCB antenna,
    since plenty of commerical products just use these modules too. So far
    I have continued to resist making version 4 to do this. The features I
    did not resist adding were a gas sensor, and of course an addressable
    <abbr title="Red/Green/Blue Light-Emitting Diode">RGB LED</abbr>, but
    that last one should go without saying.
  </p>

  <p> You wouldn't think it from reading this, but of my hobby projects, this
    might be the one to survive the furthest through development in the war
    against feature creep. It has killed many an innocent project. </p>

  <p> I decided to pay a bit more attention when designing the PCB for this
    version, and make it a nice shape that clears out of the way of the
    WiFi antenna. I also made the ground plane on the back much more
    contiguous and less chopped up by traces. I won't pretend to have a
    good understanding of the wizardry that is
    <abbr title="Electromagnetic Compatibility">EMC</abbr> , but as I
    understand it, this is what a wise layout artist would do.
  </p>

  <p> Another fun technical bit was wiring the USB differential pair from the
    connector to the module, which I interestingly put on complete opposite
    sides of the board. I got to use KiCADs feature of adding precisely the
    right amount of wiggle to one trace to make the two traces exactly the
    same length. This is good practice, but in the real world I tested
    using raw USB with an ESP32-C3 module deadbugged into a breadboard and
    that worked fine, so USB 1 at the speed of serial must be very
    forgiving if it can survive that treatment. </p>

  <p> To make future development easier, I took a large area of free space on
    the board and turned it into perfboard by adding a lot of unconnected
    through-hole footprints. I ordered the boards, this time with a stencil
    for the solder paste, which increased the shipping cost by quite a
    bit. </p>

  <p> When soldering it, I had assumed the hardest part would be the 8-pin
    <abbr title="Dual Flat No-lead">DFN</abbr>
    package of the BMP280 that was 2 by 1.5 mm, but it was actually the
    micro USB connector that gave me the most soldering trouble. Once
    everything was soldered on, nothing would power up, and the 1.8 V
    regulator was feeling extremely toasty. After poking around for a
    while, I checked the schematic and I'd connected VDD and VSS
    (positive and negative) of the
    SGP30 gas sensor backwards, so I had to desolder it. Sadly the 6-pin
    DFN package was too difficult to bodge, so I had to order a second
    revision. To be fair, three versions of the project that worked "first
    time" would have been asking a bit much.
  </p>

      Light Weather V3, which <em>just</em> fits on one page
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p> In the time it took for the second issue to arrive with the cheapest
    shipping, I had ported the firmware to the ESP32 C3 and added the new
    features except for the gas sensor. Conveniently for me, the Adafruit
    libraries for their breakout boards worked the same for the raw ICs, so
    development was very easy. The code was quite straightforward, a class
    that looked after each device e.g. the
    <abbr title="Light-Emitting Diode">LED</abbr> or WiFi, and some queues to
    coordinate between them. The sensor readings were taken once a minute,
    and then on the fifth minute, the code would take the median value of
    the 5 and send that over MQTT.
  </p>

  <p> The code could be re-written to use a lot less of the resources of the
    ESP32, but even the cost-optimised C3 has way more resources than I can
    waste. This loosely-coupled approach to the firmware was helpful as it
    meant across the various versions of the project, and some other
    projects I've done, the parts of the code are pretty much copy-pastable
    between them. This is another fun benefit of making a project to be
    used mostly by me, I can be wasteful to make things easier for myself
    as much as I like. </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p> The project has successfully sat there on my shelves for a few months
    now, and seems to have worked without any outages the whole time. I'm
    counting the fact that I've resisted making version 4 and kept using
    version 3 as a success. Many of my projects have not been so lucky.
  </p>

  <p> I enjoyed making it, and it made me learn a new skill too. I don't
    think making your own is for everyone, but I'd recommend having a go at
    making my version 0 or 1 to anyone as it could be done in an afternoon.
    Unlike my usual software projects that usually run out of sight on my
    Pi, having a semi-professional looking product that you can pick up and
    hold is very satisfying. </p>

  <p> Despite all this talk of not making version 4, I am thinking about
    putting an
    <abbr title="Inter Integrated Circuit">I2C</abbr>
    <abbr title="Organic Light-Emitting Diode">OLED</abbr> screen on the
    prototyping area so that I can make a
    standalone version that anyone could use. I've got a screen that's the
    exact right shape, so it seems rude not to. Since it shouldn't involve
    changing the PCB, it counts as still being version 3 in my opinion.
  </p>

  <p> A noticeable downside of this project is that it's made me look at all
    my previous electronics projects and wonder how much better they'd look
    if I made them a custom PCB. I'm too used to software projects that
    don't cost anything. </p>
